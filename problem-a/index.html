        <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the protagonist of the hit Shonen Jump series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409591/">Naruto</a>
            and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988824/?ref_=tt_sims_tt">Naruto Shippuden</a>.
            He is a ninja of the Uzumaki clan and the jinchuriki of the Nine-Tails.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>He's also known as "The Show-off, Number One Unpredictacble, Noisy Ninja" - what's not to like about that!</li>
            <li class="important">Naruto's kind of the underdog, despite being the protagonist. He sets his dreams high and doesn't ever give up,
                even when the odds are stacked against him.
            </li>
            <li>He's also really slow (not very bright), but he makes up for it with hard work and determination.</li>
        </ul>
